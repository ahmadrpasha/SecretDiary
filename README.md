Project Title: Password Protected Diary  
Brief Description  
An application that imitates a ‘secret diary’. Content of the diary is saved on the server and can be viewed upon unlocking the diary. Upon first use, the user sets a password. The user must then use the password every time he/she wants to unlock the diary. If the password entered is wrong the user will be denied entry. 
There is an option on the main page of the server to add a new entry. Other features include: a ‘clear’ button that erases all content in the new entry, as well as buttons to edit text such as bold, italic, and underline.   
The application would also include a weather dashboard that displays the weather at the location that the user is in.  

User Story: As a person who wants to journal down their day, I want a password-protected diary such that I can write down my thoughts with privacy.
